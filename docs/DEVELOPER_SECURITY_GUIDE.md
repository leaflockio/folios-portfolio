## 🔑 Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**
   - Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
   - Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts.

2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by enabling MFA wherever possible.

3. **Secure Your Devices**
   - Keep your operating system and software up to date.
   - Use antivirus software and a firewall to protect against threats.

4. **Protect Your Code**
   - Avoid committing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) to version control.
   - Use `.env` files for environment variables and add them to `.gitignore`.

5. **Be Cautious with Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
   - Use tools like [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-audit) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to scan for security issues.

6. **Practice Safe Browsing**
   - Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading untrusted files.
   - Use a secure browser and enable privacy settings.

## ✅ Do's & ❌ Don'ts

### Do's

- **Lock Your System:** Always lock your device when stepping away, even for a short period.
- **Use Screen Savers:** Set up an automatic screen lock after a short period of inactivity.
- **Regularly Monitor Systems:** Keep an eye on security updates and patches for your operating system and important software.
- **Report Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any unusual behavior or potential security breaches.
- **Keep Backup:** Regularly back up your work and sensitive data in a secure location.

### Don'ts

- **Don't Leave Your System Unattended:** Avoid leaving your device logged in and unattended in public or shared spaces.
- **Don't Share Credentials:** Never share passwords or sensitive configuration details with unauthorized persons.
- **Don't Ignore Security Updates:** Failing to install software and security updates can leave your systems vulnerable.
- **Don't Connect to Untrusted Networks:** Avoid using public or unsecured networks without proper protection (e.g., VPN).
- **Don't Overlook Physical Security:** For example, leaving your workstation open in a shared office or public place increases risk.
